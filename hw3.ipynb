By switching, your first pick was incorrect and you switch to the correct prize. The more doors that you add, the higher probability you win if you switch. Since you already have an empty one, the host must open every other door but the prize door. With 3 doors, its a 1/3 and 2/3 probability. For 10 doors and opening 8, the probability increases to 1/10 and 9/10. Even if you keep adding more doors, there is a higher chance that you pick the wrong door, so when the hosts leaves only 2 doors left,1 which must be the prize, it nearly guarantees you to switch to win. The only chance by switching do you lose is when you already have the prize one, which is also a lesser probability."
